AMD GPU Semantic Kernel for Arch and FreeBSD 
This API is a KornShell project. The inspiration was from the lack of linear algebraic KornShell compilers for AMD GPUs. I run a dual GPU Workstation with an AMD RX570 and a GTX 1660 SUPER and DSL was mainly for NVIDIA based WorkStations. It's simple and gets the job done. Ideally I'd like to get this to run on openSUSE next as that is my daily driver. As a full time student I don't know how realistic that is in an efficient manner.
